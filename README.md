# Outer Wilds for the Sims 4
This project aims to add some Outer Wilds content into the Sims 4. There is a single mod branch (but more will be added):

* OW_Inhabitants (Echoes of the Eye)

## Installation (Windows)
To install this project on Windows (manually), I recommend you download the latest release and extract it to your Sims 4 mod folder. This should be located under **Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4/Mods/**. If it is installed correctly, you should see a list of mods the next time you load the game.
